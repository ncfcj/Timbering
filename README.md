## Timbering

Timbering is an open-source plugin for Spigot Minecraft servers to help gather wood more efficiently.

- This is my first Minecraft mod, and my first ever Java project.
- Made for Minecraft 1.20.4
- Basically, i couldn't find any Timber mod that worked on the newest Minecraft Log blocks, so i made my own so i could use it.
- I tried to make the code as cristal clear as i could, so beginners like me could understand and maybe make something more out of it.

  # How to Use
- Download and Setup SpigotMC server.
- Put the Timbering jar inside of the plugins folder on the server main folder.
- That's it, Enjoy.
